|-----|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | LMSYS Chatbot Arena | https://chat.lmsys.org | Currently one of the most popular interactive leaderboards. It uses an Elo ranking mechanism similar to chess tournaments, allowing users to anonymously participate in real-time battles between two AI models. Rankings are dynamically updated based on user preferences, reflecting the true output quality of models and capturing subjective user experience. The core value of Arena is that it relies on real user feedback rather than traditional metrics. |
| 2 | Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard | https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard | As a representative of the open-source ecosystem, Hugging Face has launched an open, transparent, and reproducible LLM leaderboard. It mainly relies on EleutherAI's LM Evaluation Harness tool and integrates a series of classic benchmarks such as MMLU (multidisciplinary knowledge), MGSM (multilingual mathematical reasoning), TruthfulQA (factual consistency), and GPQA (advanced scientific reasoning). It is suitable for evaluating large models' baseline performance on professional knowledge. |
| 3 | Stanford HELM | https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/ | Stanford University's HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) is a well-structured and multi-dimensional evaluation framework. It scores models from multiple dimensions such as accuracy, robustness, fairness, and bias, helping to comprehensively understand a model's capability boundaries and potential risks. This multi-dimensional evaluation especially supplements policy, ethics, and responsible AI system assessments for enterprise teams. |
| 4 | OpenCompass | https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/home | ModelScope - OpenCompass by Alibaba Cloud is a multimodal large model evaluation platform. It supports not only traditional text tasks but also new evaluation tasks such as image understanding (MMBench), video Q&A (MVBench), and visual mathematical reasoning (MathVista). It mainly expands support for multimodality but essentially still follows the benchmark + leaderboard + accuracy/elo approach. |
| 5 | AlpacaEval | https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval | Developed by the Stanford team, AlpacaEval is an automated model comparison tool (LLM Judge). It uses top models like GPT-4 to judge the quality of answers between two models, enabling rapid ranking of models. Compared to manual scoring, this method is lower cost and more efficient, suitable for quickly evaluating output quality during model iteration. |
| 6 | Xbench | https://www.xbench.org/ | On May 26, 2025, Sequoia China launched xbench, a tool aimed at improving the effectiveness and fairness of AI model testing through innovative evaluation methods. 1) Dynamic update mechanism: xbench dynamically updates the test set to keep up with the rapid evolution of AI technology, ensuring fairness and effectiveness. 2) Dual-track evaluation system: In addition to building multi-dimensional datasets to evaluate the theoretical upper limit of models (covering reasoning, culture, ethics, creativity, and professional fields), it also focuses on the practical performance of AI agents in real scenarios, ensuring that test results are closely related to enterprise needs. |
| 7 | Google BIG-Bench | https://github.com/google/BIG-bench | A collaborative benchmark intended to probe large language models and extrapolate their future capabilities. It brings together more than 200 tasks covering reasoning, culture, ethics, creativity, and professional fields. BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) selects tasks that are challenging even for GPT-4, becoming an important standard for testing model generalization, reasoning depth, and boundary capabilities. |
| 8 | OpenAI Evals | https://github.com/openai/simple-evals | This toolkit, open-sourced by OpenAI, is mainly used to support the capability evaluation data accompanying its latest model releases. OpenAI HealthBench has also released 5,000 multi-turn medical professional dialogues within it. |
| 9 | EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness | https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness | Although not a visual leaderboard, it is the evaluation engine/tool behind many leaderboards. It provides a complete set of modular evaluation tasks, covering benchmarks such as MMLU, BoolQ, LogiQA, TruthfulQA, and RealToxicityPrompts. It supports local deployment and custom extensions. Many leaderboard data are based on this framework. If you need to deeply customize your evaluation system, EleutherAI's tool is a very good starting point. |
